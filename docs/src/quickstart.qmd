# Basic concepts

## Step
Your data science experiment consists of many steps.
For example, data loading step, data preprocessing step, model training step, model evaluation step, and so on.
In Villard, an experiment is a collection of steps.
Each step is a function that takes some parameters and returns a result.
The parameters can be some user-defined data, or the result from other steps.
Interconnected shapes resemble a directed graph, and we call it a _pipeline_.

## Run
A run is the execution of all the steps in pipeline, from the beginning to the end.

Consider following example:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  load_data --> preprocess_data;
  preprocess_data --> train_model;
  train_model --> evaluate_model;
  preprocess_data --> evaluate_model;
```
Each box represents a step.
The arrows represent the dependencies between steps.
A single run of the example pipeline would be the execution starting from `load_data` to `evaluate_model`.


# Hello world pipeline

For our first example, let's consider the following simple pipeline:
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    get_name --> greet;
```

Villard is all about pipeline orchestration.
It is designed to cope with frequent pipeline changes.
All pipeline definitions and changes are made in configuration files.
Let's create one. In your project folder, create a `config.yml` file.
At very least, a configuration file must contain a `pipeline_definition` section, and that section must contain `_default` key.


```yaml
node_implementation_modules:
    - implementation

pipeline_definition:
    _default:
        combine_name:
            first_name: "John"
            last_name: "Doe"
        greet:
            name: "ref::combine_name"
```
It also accommodates multiple pipelines, so you may add more definitions other than `_default`.

The `combine_name` node will take the values of `first_name` and `last_name`.
This node will output a string that is the concatenation of both names.
The output of `combine_name` is then passed to `greet` node to be displayed.
Note that the `name` value of `greet` node is `ref::combine_name`.
It means that the `greet` node refers to the output of `combine_name` node (which is the concatenation names).

Then we make the pipeline nodes' implementation in `implementation.py`.

```{python}
#| eval: false
from villard import V

@V.node("combine_name")
def combine_name(first_name, last_name):
    return first_name + " " + last_name

@V.node("greet")
def greet(name):
    print ("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

Now execute the pipeline by invoking following command:

```bash
$ villard run config.yml
```
